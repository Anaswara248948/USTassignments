            In this article, we will know the HTML Elements, along with understanding the various available elements & their syntax through the examples. An HTML element is a collection of start and end tags with the content inserted in between them.
        </p>

        <p>
           <b>HTML Element: The HTML element consists of 3 parts.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opening tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material starts.</li><br>
                <li>Closing tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material ends.</li><br>
                <li>Content: It is the actual content material inside the opening and closing tag.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            <u><i>Combining all these 3 parts results in an overall HTML Element.</i></u>
        </p>

            Necessary to add an end tag: It is necessary to add the end tag of an element. Otherwise, the displayed content may or may not be displayed correctly. It is a good practice if you add closing tags to the non-void HTML Elements but nowadays browsers are getting more and more advanced and forgiving in nature and that’s why if you somehow forget to apply the closing tag in the non-void Element, the browser will not throw any error but the problem will arise as you insert more and more HTML elements after that.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            A web browser is forgiving but it doesn’t mean that you start ignoring the ending/closing tag of the HTML elements. It might show some unexpected behaviour or error in some cases. Like if you have more than one HTML element on your webpage then omitting the closing tag might result in clashing of the boundaries of different HTML elements. The browser won’t know where it ends. It will take the next tag and think it belongs to the previous tag without the closing tag.
        </p>

        <i>Always put the closing tag to a non-void HTML element</i>
