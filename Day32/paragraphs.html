            In this article, we will know the HTML Paragraph, & its basic implementation through the examples. The p tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within p and /p is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we don’t use the closing tag i.e, /p, but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is a good convention, and we must use the closing tag.

            Key Points: When we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph. HTML does this by default. Let’s look at a few properties of the paragraph tag: 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            As already mentioned, the<p>tag automatically adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them to a single space.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.
