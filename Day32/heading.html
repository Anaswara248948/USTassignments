            In this article, we will know HTML Headings, & their implementation through examples. An HTML heading tag is used to define the headings of a page. There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

            <ul>
                <li> h1 is used for the main heading. (Biggest in size)</li><br>
                 <li>h2 is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under the subheadings then the h3 elements are used. </li><br>
                    <li>h6 for the small heading (smallest one).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
